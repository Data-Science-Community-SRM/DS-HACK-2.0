        "description": "Time series forecasting is the process of predicting future values of a time series based on past observations. It is a common task in many industries, including finance, retail, and manufacturing. Time series forecasting can be used to predict sales, inventory levels, and other business metrics. It can also be used to predict the weather, stock prices, and other non-business metrics. Time series forecasting is a challenging problem because it requires predicting the future based on past observations, which are often noisy and incomplete. There are many different approaches to time series forecasting, including autoregressive models, moving average models, and neural networks."

        "description": "Data storytelling is the process of translating data analyses into laymanâ€™s terms in order to influence a business decision or action. It is a structured approach for communicating data insights through visualizations, which can be used to support decision-making. Data storytelling is a combination of three key elements: data, visuals, and narrative. Data is the foundation of the story, visuals are used to communicate the insights, and narrative is the glue that holds it all together."
